This is the first public release of PSX memory card manager. It is released under the terms of the general public license.

It still has a few limitations:

- Does not handle correctly multiple block saves
- Edit title not available
- No way to read or edit dexdrive comments
- No configuration dialog(and no configuration file)


To compile, do 'make'.

If you want to change the parallel port IO port, edit card_link.c

Feel free to e-mail me if you have problems, questions, or wish to help.
