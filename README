This is a graphical tool for managing PSX memory card images.
It is released under the terms of the general public license version 3.

It still has a few limitations:

- Does not handle correctly multiple block saves
- Edit title not available
- No way to read or edit dexdrive comments
- No configuration dialog(and no configuration file)


To compile, do 'make'. You may need to install some packages such as libqt4-dev. And
you may need to edit QTDIR in the Makefile to point at the right place so the moc tool
gets found.

If you want to change the parallel port IO port, edit card_link.c

Feel free to e-mail me if you have problems, questions, or wish to help.
